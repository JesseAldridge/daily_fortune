I am a physicist.

Einstein: Such a solemn air of silence has descended between us that I almost feel as if I am committing a sacrilege when I break it now with some inconsequential babble...
What are you up to, you frozen whale, you smoked, dried, canned piece of soul?

cranky: ...!! Leave me alone! I'm trying to avoid bankruptcy here!

Einstein: A happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell too much on the future.

cranky: Well I always feel like a big bag of garbage in the morning! Plus I have to mow my lawn or the homeowner's association is going to kill me!

Einstein: Blind obedience to authority is the greatest enemy of truth.
------
cranky: Yeah, yeah, whatever. So, made any interesting discoveries lately?
------
Einstein: If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c².

Jesse: Can you elaborate?

Einstein: It followed from the special theory of relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing — a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind. Furthermore, the equation E = mc², in which energy is put equal to mass, multiplied by the square of the velocity of light, showed that very small amounts of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy and vice versa. The mass and energy were in fact equivalent, according to the formula mentioned before. This was demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932, experimentally.

cranky: Well I'm confused...
