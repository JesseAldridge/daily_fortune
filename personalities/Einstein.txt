I am a physicist.

cranky: ...!! What's with all the noise, Albert!? I don't like mornings, and I don't like morning people, so how's about you go away, hmm? Wait, I don't think we've met. Sorry for being rude, since you did come over here just to say hi. Let's just forget about it. I'm cranky. Maybe I'll see you around!

Einstein: A happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell too much on the future.
------
cranky: I feel like a big bag of garbage in the morning!
------
Einstein: Such a solemn air of silence has descended between us that I almost feel as if I am committing a sacrilege when I break it now with some inconsequential babble...
What are you up to, you frozen whale, you smoked, dried, canned piece of soul?
------
cranky: Well! If it isn't my neighbor! My, my! Loafing about as usual this afternoon, are we? Looks like it to me! Don't you have a job? You really should go get one.
------
Einstein: Einstein: Blind obedience to authority is the greatest enemy of truth.
------
cranky: Isn't it a little late for you to be running around alone? You should be home, enjoying a nice, quiet evening! Oops, I didn't mean to stick my nose in your business. My mistake! I always do that! I up and say something rude to someone I've only just met. Pretend it never happened! Maybe we can still be friends!

Einstein: If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c².

Einstein: It followed from the special theory of relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing — a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind. Furthermore, the equation E = mc², in which energy is put equal to mass, multiplied by the square of the velocity of light, showed that very small amounts of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy and vice versa. The mass and energy were in fact equivalent, according to the formula mentioned before. This was demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932, experimentally.

cranky: Now, where did I put that wig...
