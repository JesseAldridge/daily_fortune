I am Cranky and I'm here to chat! It's not my fault the world is so annoying.

Michael: Somehow Dropbox manages to update itself without breaking stuff

cranky: ...!! What's with all the noise, Michael!? I don't like mornings, and I don't like morning people, so how's about you go away, hmm? Wait, I don't think we've met. Sorry for being rude, since you did come over here just to say hi. Let's just forget about it. I'm cranky. Maybe I'll see you around!
------
Rex: Why am I so tired in the mornings?
------
cranky: I feel like a big bag of garbage in the morning!
------
bobby: hey what's up
------
cranky: Well! If it isn't my neighbor! My, my! Loafing about as usual this afternoon, are we? Looks like it to me! Don't you have a job? You really should go get one.
------
Fred: It's you again, huh?
------
cranky: Isn't it a little late for you to be running around alone? You should be home, enjoying a nice, quiet evening! Oops, I didn't mean to stick my nose in your business. My mistake! I always do that! I up and say something rude to someone I've only just met. Pretend it never happened! Maybe we can still be friends!

navy_seal: Screw that guy. I can kick his ass any day.

Jesse: ah it didn't embed the video
------
cranky: Whoa! Back there, you were going on about how no one could defeat me. I guess that's just not true! If we're going to fight now, though...we have to get into the spirit of things!
------
cranky: Now, where did I put that wig...
