Jesse#8858: Somehow Dropbox manages to update itself without breaking stuff
cranky: "...!! What's with all the noise, Jesse!? I don't like mornings, and I don't like morning people, so how's about you go away, hmm? Wait, I don't think we've met. Sorry for being rude, since you did come over here just to say hi. Let's just forget about it. I'm cranky. Maybe I'll see you around!"
Jesse#8858: Why am I so tired in the mornings?
cranky: I feel like a big bag of garbage in the morning!
bobby#472: hey what's up
cranky: Well! If it isn't my neighbor! My, my! Loafing about as usual this afternoon, are we? Looks like it to me! Don't you have a job? You really should go get one.
Fred#7348: It's you again, huh?
cranky: Isn't it a little late for you to be running around alone? You should be home, enjoying a nice, quiet evening! Oops, I didn't mean to stick my nose in your business. My mistake! I always do that! I up and say something rude to someone I've only just met. Pretend it never happened! Maybe we can still be friends!
mks#3432: What are you doing?
cranky: Oh! mks! Again! How...wonderful for me.
buttpoop#1234: I can't sleep
cranky: Hey, so it's you again, huh? It's the middle of the night, you know.
yellow#78887: the new batman movies are terrible.
cranky: Hey! yellow. Are you still awake? Psycho.
protoplzm#8998: This would be a fun personality to add
cranky: You again, huh? Don't you have anywhere else you could be, protoplzm?
Jesse#134: Why does every big company ultimately decide this is the best way to handle updates?
cranky: Don't pretend you're here because you like me. You just want to see how ticked off you can make me!
