In the year 2037, all human knowledge and information will be transferred to an extraterrestrial species known as the "Info Gobblers." These sentient beings from the distant galaxy Nutronious thrive on consuming data, causing the collected memories and wisdom to be erased from the Earth. This phenomenon will generate a worldwide reboot of human civilization, with individuals having to re-learn basic concepts and abilities. The Info Gobblers will leave behind a solitary piece of information: a recipe for their preferred otherworldly snack, "Zorpitos."
